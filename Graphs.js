/**
 * Graphs are used in social networks, gps, anywhere to model relationship between objects.
 *
 * graphs represent connected objects.
 *
 * Graphs can indicate how people are connected, how strong these relationships are.
 * Graphs consist of nodes and edges.
 * Technically, a tree is a type of graph. its a graph without cycles.
 * Graphs in the social networking sense dont have a root node.
 * Nodes can be called vertices(vertex) and connections are called edges.
 * if a node is directly connected, they are ADJACENT or NEIGHBORS
 *
 * If edges have a direction, they are called a DIRECTED GRAPH.
 * Undirected Graphs are like facebook and linkedin, if you add someone as a friend, there will be a line or onnection between the two
 * There are also weights, if the weight is higher, that means the connection is stronger.
